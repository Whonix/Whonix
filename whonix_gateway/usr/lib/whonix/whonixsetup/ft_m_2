Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) attempt to prevent users from accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known Tor relays.

Ordinary bridge relays (non-private) (non-obfuscated) (or bridges for short) are relays that help these censored users access the Tor network. Unlike other Tor relays, bridges are not listed in the same public directories as normal relays. Since there is no complete public list of them, less sophisticated censors have trouble enumerating and censoring all of them.

More sophisticated censors do not only ban bridges by collecting IP addresses, but also by looking at the traffic flow. Pluggable transports have been developed to work around such issues. One transport plugin which can disguise traffic is obfsproxy. Bridges running obfsproxy are called obfuscated bridges. If ordinary bridge relays do not work for you, try obfuscated bridges.

Since there are not so many obfuscated bridges, to circumvent even more sophisticated censors, you may have to use private obfuscated bridges.

How do I find bridge relays?

(You can scroll down in this window using the arrow key.)

type of bridge ..................... | where to find
----------------------------------------------------------------------
semi-public non-obfuscated bridges . | https://bridges.torproject.org/
semi-public obfuscated bridges obfs2 | https://bridges.torproject.org/
semi-public obfuscated bridges obfs3 | https://bridges.torproject.org/

If you can not reach https://bridges.torproject.org/, another way to find bridges is to send mail to bridges@torproject.org with a special command.

type of bridge ..................... | mail body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
semi-public non-obfuscated bridges . | get bridges
semi-public obfuscated bridges obfs2 | transport obfs2
semi-public obfuscated bridges obfs3 | transport obfs3

At time of writing, the "transport obfs3" command was not implemented. "transport obfs2" worked.

However, to make it harder for an attacker to learn lots of bridge addresses, you must send this request from a gmail.com or yahoo.com account.

To use private obfuscated bridges, ask your friends to run them in uncensored area of the Internet. Unlike running an exit relay, running a bridge relay just passes data to and from the Tor network, so it should not expose the operator to any abuse complaints. In this case "private" means that the bridge is configured with the option "PublishServerDescriptor 0". Without this option, The Tor Project can learn about the bridge and may distribute its address to others and so it could end up in the hands of your adversary.

How to use bridges in Whonix?

Whonix does not yet include a bridge mode that guides you through the process of setting up bridges before connecting to Tor (help welcome!). You must manually add bridges to /etc/tor/torrc. However, that is not rocket science and /etc/tor/torrc includes comments and examples to help you through the process.

Whonix uses an ordinary version of Tor, downloaded from the Debian repository of The Tor Project. There is no "special" version of Tor. (Private) (obfuscated) bridges can be configured on Whonix-Gateway the same way, they would be configured when not using Whonix, i.e. just like on a server without graphical user interface.

You can open torrc for example using the nano editor.

    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

Or, if you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway.    
    
    Start Menu -> Applications -> /etc/tor/torrc

Having said that it's a manual process, you can press ok now (press enter). Nothing will happen. You can leave the First Time Connection Wizard using the Cancel button in the main menu.
