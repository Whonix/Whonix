Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not hide the fact that you are using Tor. If this matters, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a Tor bridge relay rather than connecting directly to the public Tor network. Ultimately, the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the safer it will be to use it. Convince other people to use Tor, too!

Note: whonixsetup activates Tor by commenting out "DisableNetwork 1" in /etc/tor/torrc.

Enable Tor and connect to the Tor network?

returned exit code $returncode. There is something wrong with your /etc/tor/torrc. Tor will NOT work. This is most likely a problem with your /etc/tor/torrc (and not whonixsetup). Please fix your /etc/tor/torrc.

You can open /etc/tor/torrc in the terminal:

    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

Or, if you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway:
    
    Start Menu -> Applications -> /etc/tor/torrc

Running:

   sudo service tor restart

might help with troubleshooting.
