## Whonix /etc/apt/preferences.d/50_banned-packages

## Prevent conflicting software from getting installed, just in case.
##
## Advanced users who know what they are doing are free to comment packages of
## their choice out and therefore make them installable again.

## Additionally a empty Tor package has been installed on Whonix-Workstation
## to prevent Tor over Tor and to satisfy some dependencies on Tor, for
## example for TorChat.

## NTP does not work over Tor because it uses UDP.
## If it were to work, it would not be secure, because
## it is by default not encrypted. Whonix has its own
## safe network time synchronization mechanism. See
## Whonix design.
