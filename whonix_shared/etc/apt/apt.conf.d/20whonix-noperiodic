## Whonix /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20whonix-noperiodic

## Disable automatic update check APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists
## which is the Debian default in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic.
##
## The execution time would be too predictable, thus make Whonix fingerprintable.
## whonixcheck runs after boot and every day at a random time and checks for updates.
##
## 20whonix-noperiodic comes after 10periodic in alphabet so it takes precedence.
##
## Quoted from the Debian Handbook
## http://debian-handbook.info/browse/wheezy/sect.apt-get.html
##
## "[...] Each directory represents a configuration file which is split over multiple
## files. In this sense, all of the files in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ are instructions
## for the configuration of APT. APT includes them in alphabetical order, so that the
## last ones can modify a configuration element defined in one of the first ones. [...]
##
## That changes take effect can be verified using:
## apt-config dump

APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "0";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";
