## Please use "/etc/whonix.d/50_desktop_user" for your custom configuration,
## which will override the defaults found here. When Whonix is updated, this
## file may be overwritten.

## This file is responsible for configuring /etc/profile.d/80_desktop.sh,
## which is a script, which decides based on these settings, whether to
## autostart the login manager (graphical desktop environment) or not.

## If set to 1, this feature is enabled.
## Otherwise, it will be completely disabled.
## When not enabled, it might make sense to run
## "sudo update-rc.d kdm defaults" to re-enable autostart of kdm,
## if that is your display manager.
whonixdesktop_autostart_decision_feature=1

## If set to 1, it will start the display manager,
## if there is enough total RAM (configurable below).
whonixdesktop_start_display_manager=1

## Minimum amount of total RAM, which has to be available
## to start the display manager. If less RAM is
## available, no display manager will be autostarted.
## Note: When using VirtualBox, Video RAM gets subtracted from the total
## amount of RAM, which RAM Desktop Loader can detect minus a few other MB RAM.
## So better set the amount of minimum RAM a bit lower than your threshold.
## By default we use 480 MB below, so a minimum of 500 MB RAM will load a
## desktop.
whonixdesktop_minium_ram=480

## When set to 1, the check for enough total RAM
## will be disabled.
whonixdesktop_skip_ram_test=0

## If set to 1, wait a configurable (below)
## amount of seconds, before starting the
## display manager. During this perioid you
## can press "ctrl + c" to abort starting
## the display manager.
whonixdesktop_wait=1

## If whonixdesktop_wait is set to 1,
## wait the following amount of seconds,
## before starting the display manager.
## During the waiting period you could press "ctrl + c" to abort starting a
## display manager.
whonixdesktop_wait_seconds=10

## Set to 1 to enable debugging.
whonixdesktop_debug=0

## Disable update-rc.d $dm remove in display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke:
## kdm, gdm, lightdm, slim, wdm, xdm, nodm.
## Only set to 1 if you know what you are doing.
whonixdesktop_disable_rc_d_remove=0

## Leave the following two lines as they are, unless you know what you are
## doing.
default_display_manager="$(cat "/etc/X11/default-display-manager")"

## Which display manager /etc/profile.d/20_desktop.sh should
## start using "sudo /usr/sbin/service "$whonixdesktop_display_manager" start".
